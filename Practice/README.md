## Static Page Practice

## A static page made with css and html. Main purpose of this project was for practice with both of these langauges. 

This project was built using a reference from figma: https://www.figma.com/design/nh0V05z3NB87ue9v5PcO3R/writings.dev?node-id=0-1&t=mEvW8fLo34WNxHQP-0. I though it was a very helpful reference and helped accelerate the process by allowing me to jump right into the coding aspect.
